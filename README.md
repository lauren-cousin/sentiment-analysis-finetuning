# Sentiment Analysis Fine-Tuning Mini-Course
This mini-course was developed to guide learners through the process of fine-tuning a sentiment analysis model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The course is designed to help users understand how to categorize customer reviews by sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) with a model trained on a domain-specific dataset.

## Course Content
- `SentimentAnalysis-Finetuning-Starter.ipynb`: A starter notebook containing guided code to learn how to fine-tune and train a sentiment analysis model. This version is optimized for use on machines with minimal resources, such as free Google Colab accounts (CPU training).
- `SentimentAnalysis-Finetuning-Final.ipynb`: A completed version of the sentiment analysis fine-tuning notebook. This notebook is intended to be used as an instructional resource, allowing learners to run through the course, fill in code, and gain hands-on experience in model fine-tuning.

## Key Features
- **Model**: Fine-tunes the BERTweet model from Hugging Face for sentiment analysis.
- **Data**: Utilizes a domain-specific dataset to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to categorize customer reviews.
- **Tools & Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, Google Colab.
- **Learning Objectives**: Designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of model fine-tuning with practical, hands-on coding exercises.

## How to Use
- **Starter Notebook**: Start with the SentimentAnalysis-Finetuning-Starter.ipynb notebook to learn the basics of fine-tuning. Follow the guided instructions to train a sentiment analysis model on a small dataset.
- **Final Notebook**: After completing the starter notebook, explore the SentimentAnalysis-Finetuning-Final.ipynb to see a fully developed solution. This notebook serves as a reference and a learning tool to reinforce the concepts covered.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and open the notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab:
```
